🎬 Movie Rating Analysis

This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on a movie ratings dataset using *Python, **Pandas, and **Seaborn*.  
It focuses on uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships in movie ratings — such as average rating distribution, genre popularity, and correlation with other features.


🧠 Objective

To analyze and visualize movie rating data to:
- Understand how ratings are distributed across movies
- Compare genres and their average ratings
- Identify trends or anomalies in viewer ratings
- Demonstrate Python visualization skills with Seaborn and Matplotlib


🧩 Dataset Information

The dataset used contains the following columns (example):
- 🎞 *Movie Title* — Name of the movie  
- 🌍 *Genre* — Category of the movie (Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.)  
- ⭐ *Rating* — Viewer rating (usually from 1–10)  
- 📅 *Year* — Release year  
- 💵 *Revenue (optional)* — Box office collection

> You can use any movie rating dataset, such as IMDB, TMDB, or Kaggle samples.

 ⚙ Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Pandas*
- *NumPy*
- *Seaborn*
- *Matplotlib*
- *Jupyter Notebook*

📊 Key Insights (Example)
- Most movies have ratings between 6 and 8.  
- Action and Drama genres dominate the dataset.  
- Older movies (before 2000) show higher average critic ratings than newer releases.  
- Positive correlation observed between *revenue* and *rating* in top 100 movies.
